# VHDL
building simple ALU by writing a VHDL code
In this project you will build a simple part of a microprocessor. Firstly you will build two main blocks: the ALU and the register file, then you will connect them together and run a simple machine code program on them, and to verify at the end that your result is correct.

In order to ensure that your design is related to yourself, various aspects of the design will be dictated by your student ID numbers. These include the machine code used by your design, the contents of the register file, and the purpose of the program that you will use to demonstrate the correctness of your design. This means that every student should have a unique design.  

You have to work individually in this project and demonstrate your work to me and submit a report about your design and implementation of this project.
